## 🧠 How AI Is Used & Why It’s Helpful

Artificial Intelligence was integrated into AidLocator to make the app more intelligent and user-centric. Here's how AI improved the app:

- **Smart Search Interpretation:** The AI understands context and needs without relying solely on keyword filters.
- **During Development:** OpenAI (ChatGPT) helped with:
  - Code generation and optimization
  - UI/UX decisions
  - Geolocation and filtering logic
  - AI backend integration
  - Debugging and edge case handling

**Result:** The AI integration made the system smarter, more intuitive, and capable of delivering real help in real-time.
